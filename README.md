A modern web application for monitoring and visualizing backup operations from Duplicati Servers. Duplidash provides a comprehensive dashboard to track backup statuses, metrics, and performance across multiple machines.

## Features

- **Dashboard Overview**: Real-time display of backup status for all machines
- **Machine Details**: Detailed view of backup history for each machine
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts showing backup metrics over time
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light themes for comfortable viewing
- **Responsive Design**: Grid-based layout that works on all device sizes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

      "durationInMinutes": 90,
      "knownFileSize": 1000000
    }
  }
  ```

## Test Scripts

The project includes several test scripts to help with development and testing:

### Generate Test Data
```bash
pnpm run test:generate
```
This script generates and uploads test backup data for multiple machines. It creates 10 backup entries for each test machine.

### Test Last Backup Endpoint
```bash
pnpm run test:lastbackup [machineName]
```
Tests the `/api/lastbackup` endpoint. If no machine name is provided, it defaults to "Test Machine 1".

### Clear Database
```bash
pnpm run test:clear-db
```
Clears all data from the database and recreates the schema. Use with caution as this will delete all existing data.

## Development

### Database
The application uses SQLite3 as its database, with the database file stored in the `data` directory. The schema is automatically created when the application starts.

### Project Structure
- `/src/app`: Next.js application routes and pages
- `/src/components`: React components
- `/src/lib`: Utility functions and database operations
- `/scripts`: Test and utility scripts
- `/public`: Static assets

### Available Scripts
- `pnpm run dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm run build` - Build for production
- `pnpm run start` - Start production server
- `pnpm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm run test:generate` - Generate test data
- `pnpm run test:lastbackup` - Test last backup endpoint
- `pnpm run test:clear-db` - Clear database
- `pnpm run clean` - Clean build artifacts and dependencies
- `pnpm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Docker Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker and Portainer. There are two ways to deploy:

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wsj-br/duplidash-fb.git
cd duplidash-fb
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9666`

### Option 2: Using Portainer

1. In Portainer, go to "Stacks" and click "Add stack"
2. Name your stack (e.g., "duplidash")
3. Choose "Build method" as "Repository"
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/wsj-br/duplidash-fb.git`
5. In the "Compose path" field, enter: `docker-compose.yml`
6. Click "Deploy the stack"

### Docker Configuration

The Docker setup includes:

- Multi-stage build for smaller production image
- Volume mounting for persistent data storage
- Health checks for container monitoring
- Automatic container restart
- Environment variable configuration

#### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in Portainer:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` (default)
- `PORT`: Application port (default: 9666)

#### Data Persistence

The application data is stored in the `./data` directory, which is mounted as a volume in the container. This ensures that your data persists even if the container is removed or updated.

#### Health Monitoring

The container includes a health check that monitors the application's availability. You can view the health status in Portainer's container details.
